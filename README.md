## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Discovered the use of lighten() and darken()

Started to undertand better how to use background-image especially with SVGs.

### Continued development

The positioning of the "Change" link was annoying. The next time I am faced with a similar situation I will have to find a better way to do it.

Continue my learning on how to create and manipulate SVGs to add cool shapes on future designs.

I want to learn how to modify width based on screen width in a way that for exemple: The element must be at least 200px wide , and maximum 400px wide but is able to range between 200 and 400px.
